## What's on that busted tee?

Today we're going to launch into project mode so we're going to start off with an activity to get those creative juices flowing.

Partner up with at least one other person and play the busted tee game. Here's how it works:

+ Person 1 comes up with a graphic for a t-shirt - you can just describe it out loud or you can draw a little picture if you'd like.

  * For example: A polar bear with wings flying over a rainbow.

+ Person 2 has to produce the tag line for that t-shirt.

Give it a shot!

###Bonus
Try it the other way around. Person 1 comes up with a tag line and Person 2 has to design a t-shirt to go along with it.
